# SatelliteDataAI-UOA
This is the repository for course [761](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/GEOG/761/1255) at the University of Auckland: Satellite Data and AI. The notebooks within the course are designed to walk you through the fundamentals of handling satellite data with the objective of using it for machine learning (AI) workflows.  We start out by using [Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) in a Python environment as a learning tool, before then transferring to a purely Pythonic approach. 

The material in this course has been built on and uses the work of:
- [GEEMap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap), led by [Qiusheng Wu](https://github.com/giswqs).
- [GEOAI](https://github.com/opengeos/geoai)
- [Justin Braaten](https://github.com/jdbcode)
